In order to facilitate researchers to study intercellular communication, here we provide two methods for constructing intercellular gene regulatory networks. Gene regulatory network (GRN) includes (ligand-receptor-transcription factor-target genes). After multiple screening of the regulatory network, the number of signalling molecules is reduced, which means that the overlapping genes are analyzed by multiple communication tools Common filters can reduce false positive results using a single tool. So that we can more accurately analyze the communication mechanism between cells. Previously published tool codes are stored in CCnetwork, and the tool codes of this study are stored in IGRN.
