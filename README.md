In order to facilitate researchers to study intercellular communication, here we provide two methods for constructing intercellular gene regulatory networks. Gene regulatory network (GRN) includes (ligand-receptor-transcription factor-target genes). After multiple screening of the regulatory network, the number of signaling molecules is reduced, which means that the overlapping genes analyzed by multiple communication tools Common filters can reduce false positive results using a single tool. So that we can more accurately analyze the communication mechanism between cells.
