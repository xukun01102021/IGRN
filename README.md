To study the role of immune cells in tumor development, we constructed an intercellular gene regulatory network based on cellular interactions between malignant cells and immune cells in the TME. First, scMLnet was used to construct a preliminary version of the cell interaction gene regulatory network. The initial version of the cell interaction gene regulatory network included ligand-receptor (L-R), receptor-transcription factor (R-TF) and transcription factor-target. Gene (TF-target) information. pySCENIC was then used to identify transcription factors in malignant cells and prune gene regulatory networks. Finally, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using the Seurat “Findmarker” function to identify target genes regulated by transcription factors in the gene regulatory network. In this study, the pruned gene regulatory network was used as the final version of the microenvironment gene regulatory network based on cell interactions for subsequent analysis.
