We constructed a gene regulatory network composed of four elements: ligand-receptor-transcription factor (TF)-target. The construction of gene regulatory network is divided into four steps. First, we applied Nichenet to obtain the intercellular signal transduction network and construct ligand-receptor-TF-target links (network 1.0); second, we verified the ligand-receptor (L-R) pairs of the gene regulatory network through CellPhoneDB, retaining overlap Ligand-receptor pairs and their downstream signals (Network 2.0); Third, use SCENIC to validate Network 2.0's TF-target pairs. Retain the validated TF-targets of Network 2.0 (Network 3.0); fourth, use differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to filter important signals of Network 3.0 (Network 4.0).
